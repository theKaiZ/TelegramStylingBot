My implementation of a telegram bot that can recieve pictures and return edited versions with either deep dream algorithm (by Erik Lindner Noren) or image style transfer algorithm (Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge)
Run it on a machine with a decent NVIDIA GPU

Required python libraries:
 - Pytorch
 - python-telegram-bot
 - pillow
 - imageio
 - numpy


furthermore, you need a telegram bot token (from the botfather ot telegram) and save into textfile "token.txt" in main directory
